<p>Declarative WebGL scene graphs inside <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="here-be-dragons">Here be dragons</h2>
<p>This is not even <em>close</em> to production-ready. It&rsquo;s missing many essential features, and isn&rsquo;t optimised. The API is certain to change in substantial ways. You have been warned.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not fazed by that sort of thing, and would like to help figure out how to make this all work, contributions are very welcome.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-you-doing-this">Why are you doing this?</h2>
<p>Someone once described the DOM as &lsquo;an API that only a mother could love&rsquo;. Clearly that person had never tried to build anything with WebGL. Hand-written WebGL code is <em>phenomenally</em> ugly and confusing.</p>
<p>Because of that, people typically reach for libraries like <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> and <a href="http://regl.party/">regl</a>. I use and love both, but they each have characteristics that make them unsuitable for certain tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three is comfortably over half a megabyte minified, making it less than idea for <em>casual</em> or <em>whimsical</em> graphics — especially on low-powered devices where your JS budget is small. Typically, when you encounter Three in the wild, it&rsquo;s used for a standalone set-piece interactive</li>
<li>regl is intentionally low-level. I&rsquo;ve found it to be difficult to use for quickly iterating on an idea, because you&rsquo;re thinking in terms of <em>draw calls</em> rather than a <em>scene graph</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a> — which is a web component wrapper around Three — has demonstrated that a declarative markup-driven approach provides a great authoring experience, particularly for certain kinds of scenes. Since it builds on top of Three, it inherits its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>@sveltejs/gl is several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>An experiment to test a hypothesis that building scene graphs &lsquo;the Svelte way&rsquo; is satisfying and productive, and needn&rsquo;t cost much in terms of JavaScript</li>
<li>A way to figure out what the right APIs are</li>
<li>A test to see how much of this can be built in Svelte already (and still perform well) without needing to extend the compiler</li>
<li>A thing I need at work</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-can-i-use-it">How can I use it?</h2>
<p>Check out <a href="https://svelte.dev/repl/8d6d139a3d634c2fb1e1ff107c123dd5">this demo</a> to get started. There&rsquo;s not much point writing docs until things are a bit more settled.</p>
<h2 id="ideas-for-future-development">Ideas for future development</h2>
<p>Some of these may be a bit pie-in-the-sky:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post-processing</li>
<li>Scene graph editor</li>
<li>WebVR (this would require Svelte to be able to use the VR display&rsquo;s <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> instead of the default one, since the refresh rate on VR devices can be 90 or 120fps)</li>
<li>Interactivity (i.e. raycasting)</li>
<li>Physics</li>
<li>Interleaving DOM and GL content (i.e. part of the scene renders behind the DOM, some in front)</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the analog of server-side rendering for a GL scene — precomputing high fidelity global illumination maps etc?</li>
</ul>
